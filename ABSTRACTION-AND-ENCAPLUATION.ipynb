    "Abstraction is an essential concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to represent complex systems by focusing on their essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of common behaviors or properties without specifying the implementation. The main goal of abstraction is to provide a simplified and generalized view of an object or system, enabling easier understanding, maintenance, and reusability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of abstraction can be illustrated using the concept of a \"Shape\" in a graphics application. Consider that you want to create different types of shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles. You can define an abstract base class called \"Shape\" that defines common attributes and behaviors of all shapes, such as calculating the area and perimeter. However, you would not provide the specific implementation details for each type of shape in the abstract class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(\"Circle Area:\", circle.calculate_area())\n",
    "print(\"Circle Perimeter:\", circle.calculate_perimeter())\n",
    "\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)\n",
    "print(\"Rectangle Area:\", rectangle.calculate_area())\n",
    "print(\"Rectangle Perimeter:\", rectangle.calculate_perimeter())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape` class acts as an abstract base class with two abstract methods: `calculate_area()` and `calculate_perimeter()`. These methods define the common behavior that every shape should have, but the specific implementation is left to the concrete shape classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes inherit from the `Shape` class and provide their own implementations of the abstract methods. The `Circle` class calculates the area and perimeter based on its radius, while the `Rectangle` class calculates them based on its width and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing abstraction, we can create a generalized representation of shapes through the abstract class, while allowing different shapes to have their own specific implementations. This abstraction simplifies the code and provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and extend the system in the future."

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes and focus on different aspects of designing and implementing classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction:\n",
    "   Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It is achieved through abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of common behaviors or properties without specifying the implementation. Abstraction allows you to create generalized representations of objects or systems, making them easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Consider the concept of a \"Vehicle\" in a transportation system. We can define an abstract base class called \"Vehicle\" that includes common attributes and methods shared by all vehicles, such as `start()`, `stop()`, and `accelerate()`. However, the specific implementation details for each type of vehicle (car, bike, truck) would be defined in their respective derived classes. The abstract class provides a simplified and generalized view of a vehicle, abstracting away the specific details of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "   Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class and controlling access to them through access modifiers (such as public, private, protected). It ensures that the internal representation and behavior of an object are hidden from the outside, and interaction with the object is done through a well-defined interface. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and prevents direct access or modification of internal state from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Consider a \"Person\" class that has private attributes like `name` and `age`, along with public methods like `get_name()` and `set_age()`. The class encapsulates the data (name and age) and provides controlled access to them through the public methods. External code can access or modify the attributes only through these methods, ensuring proper validation or logic enforcement before any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and generalized view of objects or systems, while encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods together and controlling access to them. Abstraction deals with hiding unnecessary details, and encapsulation deals with hiding internal implementation details. Both concepts contribute to building well-structured, maintainable, and reusable code in object-oriented programming."

    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides mechanisms for defining abstract base classes in Python. An abstract base class (ABC) is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for creating derived classes.\n",

It ensures that any subclass derived from the abstract base class must provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",

    "Enforcing Method Overrides:\n",

    "In Python, data abstraction can be achieved by using classes and objects, along with access modifiers and encapsulation. Here are the key steps to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a Class:\n",
    "   Create a class that represents the abstract data type or concept you want to abstract. The class should contain attributes and methods that encapsulate the relevant data and behaviors associated with the abstraction. The class acts as a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "   Use encapsulation to hide the internal details and implementation of the class from the outside world. Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within the class and controlling access to them using access modifiers (such as public, private, protected).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Access Modifiers:\n",
    "   Use access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. Python provides three types of access modifiers: public, private, and protected. By convention, an attribute or method starting with a single underscore (_) is considered as protected, and starting with double underscores (__) is considered as private.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Public Interface:\n",
    "   Define a public interface for the class, which exposes only the necessary methods and attributes that external code should interact with. This interface should provide the essential functionality without exposing the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hide Implementation Details:\n",
    "   Hide the internal implementation details of the class by making attributes private or protected, and only allow access to them through public methods. This ensures that external code cannot directly manipulate or access the internal state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can achieve data abstraction in Python. The external code interacts with the abstracted data through the public interface provided by the class, while the internal implementation details are encapsulated and hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self._account_number = account_number  # Protected attribute\n",
    "        self._balance = balance  # Protected attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self._balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "            self._balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient balance.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"123456789\", 1000)\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(\"Account Balance:\", account.get_balance())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `BankAccount` class represents a bank account with attributes for the account number and balance. The attributes are defined as protected by starting their names with a single underscore (_).\n",
    "\n",
    "The class provides public methods such as `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()`, which allow external code to interact with the account. The internal implementation details, such as the attributes, are hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By encapsulating the data and controlling access to it, we achieve data abstraction, where the external code interacts with the abstracted bank account data through the provided public interface, without directly manipulating or accessing the internal attributes."
